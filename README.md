# Flask-Question-Answering-App-
This is a simple Flask web application that provides question answering functionality using a pre-trained language model from Hugging Face. The app uses the deepset/roberta-base-squad2 model to generate answers based on a user-provided context and question.
Features

Web-based interface to input context and questions

Uses Hugging Face Transformers pipeline for question answering

Displays generated answer based on the context

Clean, embedded HTML template using Flask

Lightweight and easy to deploy locally

Upon form submission, the question and context are sent to the model.

The model processes the inputs and extracts the most probable answer.

The answer is displayed on the same page below the form.
